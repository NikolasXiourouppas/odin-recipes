# odin-recipes
In this project I will be building a basic recipe website. The skills I will demonstrate thoughout this project will be able to create a boilerplate incorperating text, creating paragraphs, headings and changing the type of text these paragraphs and headings will have e.g bold  and italicized text. Lists ordered and unordered with accompanying links and images which will be the main part of a recipe website.
