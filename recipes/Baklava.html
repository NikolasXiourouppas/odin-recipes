        <h1>Sweet, Sweet Honey</h1>

        <p>This honey baklava is flaky, crisp and tender and I 
            love that it isn’t overly sweet. It’s basically a 
            party in your mouth. I am a huge fan of baklava and 
            this is the BEST baklava recipe I have ever tried. 
            Hands down.</p>

        <p>You will love the hint of mellow lemony flavor which 
            offsets the sweetness and compliments the cinnamon. 
            It’s truly delicious.</p>  
            
         <p>Store-bought baklava has nothing on this and trust me, 
            I’ve been around the block when shopping for baklava. 
            This baklava recipe is well loved wherever it goes and 
            it is definitely a reader and family favorite!</p>

            <li>100g almonds</li>
            <li>100g pistachios</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp ground cloves</li>
            <li>200g butter</li>
            <li>2x270g packets (12 sheets) of filo pastry</li>
            <li>300g sugar</li>
            <li>100ml Greek honey</li>
            <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>2 strips of orange zest</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4. Place all 
                the syrup ingredients in a medium saucepan with 
                300ml of water and bring to a gentle simmer. Let 
                it bubble away, stirring occasionally, for 15 
                minutes or until the liquid has reduced by a 
                third. Leave to cool. (The syrup must be cool 
                when it is poured over the pastry otherwise the
                 pastry will go soggy.)</li>
             <li>Blitz the nuts in a food processor until coarse, 
                then tip into a bowl and stir through the 
                cinnamon and cloves.</li>  
            <li>Melt the butter, using a little of it to lightly 
                grease a 40 x 25cm shallow tin with a pastry 
                brush. Gently unfold the filo and cover with a 
                damp tea towel to stop it cracking.</li>    
            <li>Layer sheets of filo in the tin and brush each 
                layer with melted butter. After 4 layers, scatter 
                over half the nut mixture; repeat with 4 layers 
                of filo, then the rest of the nuts. Top with the 
                last 4 layers of filo, then generously butter 
                the top. Cut into diamonds with a sharp knife – 
                ensure the blade goes right to the bottom.</li> 
            <li>Bake on the middle shelf of the oven on a hot 
                baking sheet for 30–35 minutes, or until golden 
                brown and crisp, reducing the temperature to 
                170ºC/325ºF/gas 3 if the baklava looks as though 
                it is browning too quickly.</li> 
            <li>Remove the baklava from the oven and spoon half 
                the cooled syrup over the top. Leave for 5 
                minutes, then spoon over the remaining syrup. 
                Allow the baklava to cool before removing the 
                individual pieces from the dish with a palette 
                knife.</li>
