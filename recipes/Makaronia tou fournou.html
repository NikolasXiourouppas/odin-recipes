<!--Heading of recipe-->


<p class="text">Similar to a typical lasagna, but all the more tasty. You could say a
Cypriot version of lasagna, with very different ingredients and flavours,
with lots of halloumi in it.</p>


<p class="text">The bottom layer is bucatini or other tubular pasta with cheese 
    and egg as a binder, or some of the béchamel cream.  If we do 
    not add the cream our pasta will not stick together but will 
    spread in the plate during serving.   The second layer is a 
    ground meat sauce (usually beef or veal but it can also be 
    substituted with pork, a mixture of veal and pork mince or 
    chicken or turkey mince) with fresh tomatoes and cinnamon, 
    (cloves, nutmeg and allspice are a few other spices used in 
    other regions).</p>

    <p class="text">On top of the sauce there  is another layer of pasta and 
        on top of  that is a thick creamy Béchamel sauce with 
        grated anari or halloumi and mixed in the pasta as well 
        as in the béchamel sauce and some sprinkled on top 
        together with a hint of cinnamon. </p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a sauce pan bring water to boil and add salt. 
            Cook the pasta al dente according to the package 
            instructions, for about 10 minutes, as they will be 
            cooked later on. Remove from the heat, drain and mix 
            a tablespoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a sautéing pan and sauté the 
            onion until translucent. Add the ground meat and 
            sauté for a few minutes. While mixing, add salt, 
            pepper, cinnamon and tomatoes and cook over moderate 
            heat for about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and 
            mix in parsley. When the bechamel is ready, mix in 2 
            heaped tablespoons.</li>   
        <li>Prepare the Béchamel sauce.</li> 
        <li>In the meantime beat the egg white, reserved from the 
            Béchamel sauce, and mix with the pasta as well as a 
            few tablespoons of grated halloumi or anari and 
            crumbled mint.</li>
        <li>In a baking tin (35 x 30 cm – 13.8 x 11.8 inches) 
            layer half pasta. Put the ground meat on top and add 
            the remaining pasta on top.</li>
        <li>Cover pasta with the Béchamel sauce and sprinkle with 
            some grated halloumi and some cinnamon on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in a preheated oven to 180ο C / 350o F, for about 
            45 minutes to 1 hour or until golden on top.</li>
